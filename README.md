# Fall-Ball

## Rodrigo Paoliello de Medeiros

Fall-Ball is a fast-paced, physics-based 3D game where you control a ball through a challenging environment filled with obstacles, pickups, and enemies. Your objective is to collect the pickup items while racing against time, avoid enemies, and make it to the winning platform without losing all your lives. 

## Objective
The primary objective is to reach the finish line, while avoiding the enemy and collecting the pickups.

## Game Mechanics
- Movement: Control your ball with smooth physics-based movement as you navigate the environment.
- Jumping: Jump over obstacles and gaps to avoid falling or getting stuck.
- Pickups: Collect glowing pickups scattered around the map to increase your score and decrease the countdown timer.
- Timer: A timer counts up, but collecting pickups reduces it, giving you a strategic advantage.
- Lives: The player has 3 lives; losing all lives results in a game over.
- Enemy Chase: There's a patrolling enemy that will chase you if you enter its designated area. Avoid it at all costs, as colliding with the enemy will cost you a life.
- Winning Platform: Reach the winning platform after collecting all the items to win the game.
## Controls
- Movement: Use the WASD or Arrow Keys to roll the ball in different directions.
- Jump: Press Spacebar to jump and avoid obstacles or gaps.
- Pause: Press Esc to pause the game and access the in-game menu (resume, restart, main menu).
